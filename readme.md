# Homework Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript features such as `try...catch`, `map`, `forEach`, objects, and arrays. The goal is to showcase how these features can be applied to solve various problems effectively.

## Features Implemented

1. **Error Handling with `try...catch`**: Functions that handle JSON parsing, property access, and division operations with error catching.
2. **Array Manipulation with `map`**: Functions that transform arrays using the `map` method to create new arrays based on specific criteria.
3. **Iterating Over Arrays with `forEach`**: Functions that use `forEach` to perform actions on each element of an array.
4. **Working with Objects**: Accessing and manipulating properties of JavaScript objects.
